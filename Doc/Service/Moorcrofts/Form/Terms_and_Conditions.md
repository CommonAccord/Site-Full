1.4	In this agreement, “staff” includes employees [consultants] and sub-contractors.

2.	The Agreement
2.1	These terms and conditions (including documents specifically referred to in it) are the whole of the terms and conditions governing the agreement between the parties, unless both parties agree to any amendments in writing.

3.	Definitions

3.2	Paragraph headings are merely a guide and are not intended to be a part of this agreement.
3.3	["Lease": means that
3.3.1	(in the case of hardware) title to hardware does not pass to the Customer (unless explicitly stated in, and subject to the terms of, the order);

3.4	[“Practical completion” means that software or installation has been completed to the extent that it is reasonably possible to use it for normal contemplated use, save only for any minor snagging items (which will usually be dealt with under the terms of the Customer’s warranty).]
4.	Quotations
The Customer acknowledges that:

4.1	a quotation does not amount to a contractual offer and is merely an indication that the Supplier may be willing to supply services at a particular price; 
4.2	in any event, no quotation is valid after 30 days of its issue; and
4.3	no price specified in the quotation or elsewhere includes VAT or other applicable taxes or duties unless specifically stated.
5.	Amendments to Specifications and Cancellation
5.1	5.1.	The Supplier may alter the specifications of goods, software or services from time to time so long as the alteration does not make the goods, software or services any worse. If the Customer requests that the Supplier alters the specification after the order has been placed the Supplier may consider doing so (at its discretion) on the basis that it may make an additional charge reasonable in the circumstances. A variation to the specification (including the price) (as opposed to a variation to the contract) is only valid where signed by a member of the Supplier’s authorised sales staff.
5.2	If, after an order is placed, the Customer seeks to cancel it, the Supplier may allow this at its discretion, subject to the payment of a charge equivalent to the anticipated loss due to cancellation (including loss of reasonable profit).
6.	Rights of others and Permissions
6.1	If the Supplier agrees that it is to do anything under this Agreement on the instructions of the Customer, and as a result the Supplier is in breach of any rights of any third party or is threatened with proceedings for breach of third party rights) the Customer agrees to indemnify the Supplier against any loss it may suffer, including legal costs, in defending or resisting the proceedings or claim, or settling the proceedings or claim on legal advice. The Customer’s obligations under this clause will remain in force after the rest of this Agreement has terminated, whatever the reason for termination.
6.2	The Customer shall promptly and fully notify the Supplier of any actual, threatened or potential claim that may arise under the grounds set out in Clause 6.1.
6.3	If, as a result of such a claim or threat, the Supplier decides that it is no longer commercially sensible to proceed with the order, the Supplier may cancel the order in accordance with Clause 10.
6.4	The Supplier will use all reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that nothing it does under this Agreement will infringe the rights of others. If the Supplier does anything under this Agreement which results in an actual or threatened infringement of the rights of any third party (provided that is was something which was not done at the explicit direction of the Customer or with the Customer’s specific consent) (“a Claim”) the Supplier may at its option:
6.4.1	obtain a licence or settlement of the Claim (at no cost to the Customer);
6.4.2	perform the obligation in a different way to avoid the Claim; and/or
6.4.3	cancel the agreement under clause 10.
7.	Intellectual Property
7.1	The Customer acknowledges that material of any nature which the Supplier provides, either under this Agreement or otherwise (for example, quotations or other pre-contractual material) may contain intellectual property which is either the Supplier’s property or licensed to the Supplier (including copyright, trade marks, registered and unregistered designs and patents). Nothing in this agreement is intended either:
7.1.1	licence for the Customer to use such intellectual property; or
7.1.2	transfer of such intellectual property unless explicitly stated in writing.
8.	Sub Contracting
8.1	The Supplier may sub-contract any of the services it has agreed to provide under this Agreement at its discretion.
8.2	Where the Supplier has sub-contracted any services to a third party specified by the Customer, the Supplier shall not be liable for any non-performance of that third party’s obligations, and for the purposes of this Agreement, any delay or hindrance caused by or attributable to that third party shall be considered to have been caused by the Customer.
9.	Third Party Statements
9.1	The Supplier may suggest, as part of the fulfilment of its obligations under this Agreement, that a third party carries out work or supplies goods, software or services to the Customer.  The Supplier does not guarantee that work or those goods, software or services. The Supplier accepts responsibility for the recommendation or suggestion if, at the time it was made, a professional in the Supplier’s position and based on what the Supplier has been told and in the circumstances, would not reasonably have made that recommendation or suggestion. In that case, the Supplier will accept liability as if it did the work or supplied the goods, software or services, and subject to these terms and conditions, provided that the Customer gives full conduct of any claim against the third party in question.
9.2	Where the Supplier provides goods or software originally manufactured or developed by others, the Supplier may pass on to the Customer statements or representations about such software or goods. The Supplier passes this information on to the Customer in good faith but does not undertake to verify them or guarantee their accuracy, and excludes liability except to the extent that the Supplier may have been negligent in passing on such information to the Customer.
10.	Unusual Circumstances
10.1	Where circumstances arise which are beyond the Supplier’s control which make it no longer commercially sensible for the Supplier to continue the Customer’s order, the Supplier may cancel it on the terms set out below:
10.2	If the Supplier decides to cancel the order:
10.2.1	the Supplier shall give the Customer notice, and the Supplier shall not be responsible for any loss to the Customer which arises because of that decision (although any other rights which the Customer may have arising before the Supplier made that decision will still stand); and
10.2.2	the Customer will pay the Supplier a reasonable sum in relation to the proportion of the order which the Supplier has fulfilled.
11.	Consequential Loss and Our Liability
11.1	Unless explicitly stated in the quotation in writing, the Supplier does not accept liability for consequential loss of any kind and the Supplier has priced this contract on the basis that consequential loss has been excluded. If the Customer wishes the Supplier to bear liability for consequential loss the Supplier may consider doing so but on the basis that the contract price will have to be increased to cover the increased risk, whether or not the Supplier chooses to bear it through its insurance. Consequential loss includes (but is not limited to) loss of profits, loss of anticipated savings, loss of business, loss of revenue, loss of goodwill and costs of loss of staff time.
11.2	If the Supplier has not accepted a different level of liability, its entire liability under this contract shall be limited to the value of the goods, software licences or services provided under it (or, in the case of a breach of any of the terms referred to in clause 16 below, the appropriate level of liability contained within those terms).
11.3	Nothing at all in this agreement (which includes all documentation referred to in it) is designed or intended to reduce or restrict the Supplier’s liability for the death of or personal injury to anyone caused by its negligence or the negligence of anyone for whom it is responsible or for fraud or wilful deceit.
12.	Payment of Price
12.1	The Customer must pay the Supplier the price specified in the quotation, including any VAT which may apply in accordance with the terms and on the dates contained in it (if no terms or dates are referred to, the price is payable [within 14 days of the Supplier’s acceptance of the order][immediately].
12.2	If the Customer fails to pay the whole or part of any sum it owed to the Supplier (whether because of this Agreement or not) by the time it comes due for payment, all sums which the Customer owes the Supplier (whether under this agreement or not) will become due for payment (as set out in Clause 13) immediately, and the Supplier may issue court proceedings against the Customer to recover them without giving the Customer any further notice. 
12.3	The Customer must pay the whole of the amount due, and may not set off or deduct anything from this amount without the Supplier's written permission.
12.4	The Parties agree that any sums due under this Agreement will be subject to interest at the Statutory Rate of Interest applicable under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 (irrespective of whether or not such Act applies to this agreement).
12.5	The Supplier may assign the benefit of any debt owed to it by the Customer to any third party at any time.

13.3	“On installation”: payment is due in full immediately upon practical completion (as defined below) of installation

14.	Time for Performance
14.1	Whenever the Supplier agrees to do anything by or on a particular time, the Supplier will try to do it on or at that time, but shall not be liable for late performance:
14.1.1	if late performance is beyond the Supplier’s control; or
14.1.2	unless the Customer have given the Supplier a notice allowing the Supplier a reasonable time to perform and the Supplier have failed to do so (in which case, clause 10 above may still apply).
15.	Indemnity
15.1	Where the Supplier does anything for the Customer on  the Customer’s premises (or premises under your control), the Customer agree to indemnify and keep indemnified the Supplier against any loss, damage claim or expense arising out of the physical injury or death of any of the Supplier’s staff arising in any way from the Supplier’s performance of this Agreement and arising by reason of the provision of defective equipment, the Customer’s failure to provide a safe system of work or otherwise by reason of any negligent act or default on the Customer’s part or on the part of the Customer’s servants or agents or other person on the Customer’s premises.

The Customer agrees that it will use such confidential information solely for the purposes of this Agreement and for evaluating future products or services supplied by the Supplier, and that the Customer shall not disclose, whether directly or indirectly, to any person any confidential information unless the disclosure is required to carry out this Agreement.  Before the Customer make any disclosure to another person, the Customer must obtain from them a binding commitment to keep that information confidential. That commitment must be at least as effective as this obligation is on the Customer.

19.5	The Customer agree that for at least the six month period set out above will not introduce or identify any of the Supplier’s staff to any other person with a view to that other person engaging the Supplier’s staff member.[NB, 19.4 doesn’t quite deal with this when mentioning group companies, do you need more?]
19.6	For the purposes of this clause 19, the following definitions apply:
19.6.1	“Group Company” means any company which for the time being is a subsidiary or holding company (as those expressions are defined by Section 1159 & Schedule 6 Companies Act 2006) of the relevant party or any subsidiary of any such holding company and any company which is not a subsidiary of the relevant party but whose issued Equity Share Capital (as defined in Section 548 Companies Act 2006) is owned as to at least 20% by the relevant party or any subsidiary of that party or any holding company of that party (and "Group Companies" shall be construed accordingly).

20.	Termination on Insolvency

In addition, the Customer will be liable to pay the Supplier a reasonable sum representing the work the Supplier has done up to the date of termination, which shall be calculated to include the loss of anticipated profit for the whole of the contract.
20.2	For the avoidance of doubt, it shall be reasonable for the Supplier to terminate under clause 20.1 above if any of the following occurs:
20.2.1	the presentation of a bankruptcy, or winding-up petition against the Customer or a moratorium for a company voluntary arrangement by the Customer;
20.2.2	the appointment of a manager, receiver or administrator over all or any part of the Customer’s assets;

23.	Disputes
23.1	If any dispute or grievance arises between the parties out of this Agreement, before taking any further action (such as requiring the Supplier to remedy an alleged fault within a specific time), the parties each agree that it will be discussed by staff members of each who are most closely involved with the running of the contract. If that does not produce a resolution, the problem will be escalated to the respective superiors of each staff member respectively, until the problem is dealt with. Only if the respective Chief Executive Officers of each party cannot reach agreement on the dispute will the matter be taken to the next stage as set out below.
23.2	Should the escalation mechanism set out in 23.1 above fail to be effective, before taking any other action the parties will submit in good faith to mediation in accordance with the Centre for Dispute Resolution Model Procedure or, failing that, a procedure administered by such other similar organisation as the President for the time being of the Law Society of England and Wales shall nominate.  Unless the parties agree otherwise, the costs of the mediation shall be borne equally by each of them.

24.	Rights of Third Parties
This Agreement is not intended to convey benefit on any person not a party to it and accordingly the provisions of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 are excluded.

The Supplier will take all reasonable steps necessary to uphold the Customer’s rights to protect its personal data, including the right to obtain information on, update or amend any personal data on the Customer which the Supplier holds but the Supplier will not pass on any personal data without the Customer’s prior written consent.  Where the Supplier is acting as a Data Controller as defined in the Data Protection Act 1998 the Supplier agree to maintain the security of such Personal Data as are provided to it by the Customer pursuant to such a relationship to an extent equivalent to that required by the Security Principle of that Act.

The Customer undertakes to obtain all consents, permissions and notifications necessary to enable the Customer to provide us with personal data about the Customer, and its staff, contractors, suppliers and customers which are reasonably necessary for the Supplier to perform this Agreement, including such consent as is necessary to administer this agreement including collecting and enforcing payments due under it including passing such information to the Supplier’s financiers for administration and related purposes.
