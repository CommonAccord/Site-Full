MODEL AGREEMENT
Schedule 1: Licensed Materials
A schedule dated [enter date] to the Agreement entered into on [enter date] between [enter name of Licensor] and [enter name of Licensee].
{Liblicense editors suggest that some collections may need to be described at the title level, such as subscriptions to journals, where others may be described more generally. If perpetual rights are being negotiated, Liblicense editors recommend particular attention be given to clarifying content for which perpetual rights are granted and content that is made accessible during the term of the agreement, but for which no perpetual rights are included.}
The Licensed Materials that are the subject of this Agreement are: 
[Describe licensed materials with reasonable specificity, including distinguishing between purchased content, content under subscription, and content that is merely made accessible, particularly as these distinctions relate to perpetual rights in Section 8. For example, list titles and dates, subscription periods, titles and content types included in an aggregated database, etc.]
